# FoodOrder

Structural foundation for the FoodOrder project. The current implementation includes the client shell, navigation, route placeholders, minimal in-memory cart state, API client configuration, and an Express health endpoint. The 30 frontend tasks and 11 later backend tasks in [the project plan](docs/project-analysis.md) remain backlog. There is no menu/restaurant data, authentication, checkout submission, order flow, delivery status, fake API, or database behavior.

## Requirements

Node.js 24.14.1 and npm. Install each app independently; there is no root workspace.

## Client

```sh
cd client
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Client checks: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` only when changing the API origin. The default API base is `http://localhost:5001`.

## Server

```sh
cd server
npm ci
npm run dev
```

The API listens on port 5001 by default; `GET http://localhost:5001/health` returns the health response. Set `PORT` and `CLIENT_ORIGIN` using `server/.env.example`. Server checks: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm test`.

The server currently exposes only health and safe error responses. `docs/api-contract.md` distinguishes the implemented health contract from future proposed endpoints. The json-server/db.json fake API on port 5000 is not included.
